description: I've been evaluating VS.NET 2005 and .NET 2.0<
summary: I've been evaluating <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/" target="_blank">VS.NET 2005</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">.NET 2.0</a> beta and CTP versions for a while now, but I've never had the nerve to install them on my primary development machine. In fact, a beta release installation of the v2.0 Framework totally hosed one of my test boxes. So naturally, my first question when the release version became available earlier this week was, is it really safe to install all this stuff on the same machine?<br /><br />The answer is, thankfully, yes.
