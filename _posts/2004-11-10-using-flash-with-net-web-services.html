	Macromedia's Flash platform has historically fallen into the realm of graphic design, used for all of those wonderfully irritating banners, 
	<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail51.html" target="_blank">website intros</a> and interactive CD-ROMs. A recent project that 
	called for using Flash as web-service front-end, however, demonstrated that Macromedia's commitment to XML and web services may very well 
	make it a contender in the ever changing thin client game.
  </p>
  <p>
	One particularly compelling case for connection Flash to a web service is to provide functionality to CD-ROM applications that is traditionally 
	available only in a server-context. Case-in-point: we were able to quickly build a multi-platform, email enabled multimedia product that could 
	be widely distributed via the Internet, direct mail, and the like. We simply connected Flash to a set of simple XML web services and let our 
	application server take care of the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
	Our ActionScript, which had no problem talking to our .NET based service layer, looked something like this:
  </p>
  {% highlight actionscript %}
  import mx.data.components.WebServiceConnector;

  var wsRsvp:WebServiceConnector;
  var wsValidateResult:Object = new Object();
  var wsSubmitResult:Object = new Object();
  var recipientEmail:String = "someValidEmailAddress";
  var _isAttending:Boolean = true;

  submission.var DoSubmit = function(isAttending) {
    if (isNaN(parseInt(howMany.text))) {
      trace("Number attending was NaN.");
      redAttend.play();
      prevFrame();
    }
    else {
      _isAttending = isAttending;
      if (email.text.length &gt; 0)  {
        ValidateEmail();
      }
      else {
        SubmitRsvp();
      }
    }
  }

  var ValidateEmail = function() {
    if (email.text.length &gt; 0) {
      trace("Validting email...");
      wsRsvp = new WebServiceConnector();
      wsRsvp.WSDLURL = "http://someWebServiceUrl/MyService1.asmx?WSDL";
      wsRsvp.operation = "IsValidEmail";
      wsRsvp.params = [email.text];
      wsRsvp.addEventListener("result", wsValidateResult);
      wsRsvp.trigger();
    }
  }

  var SubmitRsvp = function() {
    trace("Submitting the Rsvp...");
    wsRsvp = new WebServiceConnector();
    wsRsvp.WSDLURL = "http://someWebServiceUrl/MyService2.asmx?WSDL";
    wsRsvp.operation = "SubmitRsvp";
    wsRsvp.params = [
      firstName.text,
      lastName.text,
      _isAttending,
      parseInt(howMany.text),
      email.text,
      comments.text,
      recipientEmail
    ];
    wsRsvp.addEventListener("result", wsSubmitResult);
    wsRsvp.trigger();
  }

  wsValidateResult.result = function(e:Object) {
    trace("Validation result: " + e.target.results);
    if (e.target.results == true) {
    SubmitRsvp();
    }
    else {
    trace("Email was invalid.");
    redEmail.play();
    prevFrame();
    }
  }

  wsSubmitResult.result = function(e:Object) {
    trace("Submission result: " + e.target.results);
    if (e.target.results == true) {
     play();
    }
    else {
      trace("Rsvp could not be submitted.");
      redSend.play();
      prevFrame();
    }
  }

  stop();
  DoSubmit(true);
  {% endhighlight %}

    The important things to note here are the declaration of the WebServiceConnector objects, which are what make this all possible, and Flash's use of asynchronous
    calls to web service methods. The use of callbacks is a very cool feature&mdash;one you might not expect to find in ActionScript&mdash;but will require some
    careful planning on your part as they sometimes make simple tasks unnecessarily complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our public-facing .NET web service methods were simple and straight forward:
  </p>
  <p class="codesample">
    {% highlight csharp %}
    [WebMethod]
    public bool SubmitRsvp(string firstName, string lastName, bool isAttending,
    int numberAttending, string emailAddress, string comments, string emailAddressRecipient)
    {
      if (firstName == string.Empty || lastName == string.Empty ||
        emailAddressRecipient == string.Empty || !IsValidEmail(emailAddressRecipient))
      {
        return false;
      }

      if (emailAddress != string.Empty &amp;&amp; emailAddress != null)
      {
        if (!IsValidEmail(emailAddress))
        {
          return false;
        }
      }

      if (!isAttending)
      {
        numberAttending = 0;
      }

      return SendEmails(firstName, lastName, isAttending, numberAttending,
        emailAddress, comments, emailAddressRecipient);
    }

    [WebMethod]
    public bool IsValidEmail(string emailAddress) {
      // validate email address...
    }
    {% endhighlight %}
  </p>

    Our client's application added an additional level of complexity: the content of the CD-ROM changed for each customer,
    which got us thinking on how to best architect the service model. Our final vision was to build a framework in Flash,
    and use web services to deliver content and ActionScript logic to the movie at runtime. We found that the connectivity
    assumption that we'd have to make (already a requirement anyways) and the potential of introducing some latency into
    an otherwise fast framework were far outweighed by the ability to customize an application that's being delivered on
    a format that's typically obsolete once it leaves your office.<br /><br />You can get more information about Flash's
