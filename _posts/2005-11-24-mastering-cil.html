summary: I just finished reading <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Jason Bock</a>'s book on CIL, <em>CIL Programming: Under the Hood of .NET</em>. If you're not familiar with CIL (often abbreviated as just IL), its the core language of the .NET platform. Despite some of the poor reviews of Bock's book floating around the Internet, I found it to be a very helpful crash-course on CIL, complete with a real world sample application.<br /><br />I was originally attracted to the book because of the chapter on using .NET's reflection capabilities to generate assemblies and classes dynamically (which is, needless to say, very cool). But in the process of reading the book, I became increasingly interested in the inner workings of .NET and how CIL is mapped to the myriad .NET languages out there (FORTRAN.NET?!?!)

<div>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Jason Bock</a>'s book on CIL, <em>CIL Programming: Under the Hood of .NET</em>. If you're not familiar with CIL (often abbreviated as just IL), its the core language of the .NET platform. Despite some of the poor reviews of Bock's book floating around the Internet, I found it to be a very helpful crash-course on CIL, complete with a real world sample application.<br /><br />I was originally attracted to the book because of the chapter on using .NET's reflection capabilities to generate assemblies and classes dynamically (which is, needless to say, very cool). But in the process of reading the book, I became increasingly interested in the inner workings of .NET and how CIL is mapped to the myriad .NET languages out there (FORTRAN.NET?!?!)<br />Bock also led me to Microsoft's official CIL spec, the Partition Documents, which are the part of .NET that was submitted to ECMA for standardization. The Partition Documents describe how .NET works at a very granular level. And they are part of the Visual Studio install (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\SDK\v1.1\Tool Developers Guide\docs on my machine. There's also documentation here for the /adv ILDasm option).<br /><br />So, whats the point you ask? Well, after poring over all of these documents for the past week, I felt a little ashamed that after working with .NET for more than four years, I hadn't taken the time to really dig into the foundation of the platform. Reading Bock's book and navigating to the relevant parts of the Partition Documents, Ive not only gained a better understanding of how .NET works under the covers, but Ive learned how to optimize and modify my applications in ways impossible using languages like C# and VB.<br /><br />Even if youre never planning on coding in CIL (which would probably drive you rapidly insane), and you have no interest in designing a language or building a compiler, spending some time learning CIL and how it works can only make you a better .NET developer.<br /><br />Take a look at Bock's book and browse the Partition Documents, also available on MSDN at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/ecma/" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/ecma/</a>.<br /><br />klc;</div>
