summary: Anything that can make building software faster, easier, or more enjoyable is a welcomed addition to my toolkit. I've been seeking out more of these tools over the past few months - primarily as my interest in <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">agile methodologies</a> has grown - and have been consistently impressed with the number of high-quality, open-source, free tools available to MS.NET developers.<br /><br />To this end, I've added links to utilities that have proven themselves on the lefthand side of my blog. You'll likely notice a strong slant toward those that can automate any part of the development process or that facilitate <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">agile development</a>.<br />

<div>Anything that can make building software faster, easier, or more enjoyable is a welcomed addition to my toolkit. I've been seeking out more of these tools over the past few months - primarily as my interest in <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">agile methodologies</a> has grown - and have been consistently impressed with the number of high-quality, open-source, free tools available to MS.NET developers.<br /><br />To this end, I've added links to utilities that have proven themselves on the lefthand side of my blog. You'll likely notice a strong slant toward those that can automate any part of the development process or that facilitate <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">agile development</a>.<br />Here's an (updated) summary of the tools I've currently listed:<br /><br /><a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/">Cruise Control .NET</a> - ThoughtWorks' powerful continuous integration platform is an excellent tool for use alongside lightweight methodologies like XP and Scrum. CCNet integrates very well with build tools like NAnt, NDoc, and the like; and can automate many of the mundane build tasks like deployment, archiving, time/version stamping files, etc.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">Fiddler</a> - One of the most frustrating parts of debugging a web application is not knowing exactly what is happening between the server and web browser at the session level. You can resort to sniffing tools, but these are almost always focused at too low of a level to be readily useful. Enter Fiddler, a browser session level inspection utility. Fiddler is far and away one of the coolest utilities I've used.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dotnetfreak.co.uk/blog/archive/2004/11/06/166.aspx">FormShield</a> - I quickly learned about FormShield when a friend's blog was being filled with garbage from offshore casinos and Viagra dealers. DotNetFreak Kevin Gearing has done the blogging community a noble service by giving us this tool.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/">FxCop</a> - Microsoft's free code analysis tool for .Net, FxCop validates managed code against Micorosft's official Design Guidelines. It almost always generates more warnings than you could ever hope to address, but its a great resource for identifying critical issues in your applications. Just for fun, try running FxCop against itself :)<br /><br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp">Microsoft Enterprise Library</a> - Originally known as the Application Blocks, the Enterprise Library includes several modules that provide ubiquitous services to your applications. Cryptography, data access, exception handling, and event logging are all handled consistently through a relatively small API. The project, developed jointly by the Patterns and Practices group at Microsoft and Avanade, Inc. is also a model of pattern-based software architecture.<br /><br /><a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a> - Port of the Java world's Ant built tool. NAnt is a incredibly powerful, Xml-driven build tool that integrates well with CI tools like Cruise Control.<br /><br /><a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> - I consistently drive developers crazy with my insistence on comprehensive interal documentation. But its hard to argue against when you see the beautiful output NDoc generates when run against code that makes good use of .NET's XmlDoc tags. Having  NDoc run as part of a CI cycle and then publishing to the development team is a priceless on complex or disparate projects.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nmock.org/">NMock</a> - Used in conjunction with NUnit, NMock gives you a framework for rapidly creating mock objects for developer testing. Highly useful in projects where access to resources like databases are very expensive or impossible to access, or for death-march projects where parallel processes force an unnatural development order.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> - NUnit, a port of the well-loved JUnit, is ubiquitous with test driven development in .Net. It's also a great debugging container for n-tier applications, allowing you to step into lower levels of code directly.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector</a> - Lutz Roeders amazingly useful tool providing insight into the innards of .NET assemblies. Reflector is an excellent debugging tool, optimization tool, learning tool, and development tool.<br /><br /><a href="http://projectdistributor.readify.net/Releases/Release.aspx?releaseId=9">SR Generator</a> - If you've spent any time looking through the Enterprise Library source, you've run into this gem. The SR tool automates the generation of resource files using a format supposedly used internally at Microsoft, and provides access to resources entries to your code via constants. I've found a marked reduction in resource-manager related runtime errors in my projects by using the SR Tool.<br /><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/">Wix</a> - If you're using automated build tools for .Net projects, you've probably learned that you can't build a setup and deployment project from the command-line using csc. Enter Wix, Microsoft's free, Xml-driven MSI generator. Developing MSIs using Wix can get a little complex, but the good news is that the bulk of the work is one-off (and reusable). The Wix toolkit also contains a utility called Dark, that will reverse engineer a working MSI into Wix format!<br /><br />I'm always looking for feedback, recommendations, or tips on new tools or how to better use what I've listed.<br /><br />klc;</div>
