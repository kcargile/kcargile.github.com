<div>I finally took the time this weekend to move my site from .Text to Community Server. Community Server is an impressive package -- with several of the features that were missing from .Text&mdash;and the support community is large.<br /><br />Setting CS up was relatively painless with one specific exception: enabling a single blog configuration. Luckily, I found two great tools that made migration almost seamless. <a href="http://www.qgyen.net/csaddins/singlesite/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Ken Robertson's single site configuration tool</a> creates the correct configuration mappings for CS's URL rewriter (preventing you from having to mess around with redirects, etc.), and <a href="http://kevinharder.com/communityserver/default.aspx#DotText-CS-Converter" target="_blank">Kevin Harder's .Text migration tool</a> ports legacy .Text content over to CS.<br /><br />Both of these tools as well as the CS installation went smoothly, though I'd recommend that you test thoroughly if you're migrating a .Text site&mdash;there are several options that can't be easily changed that you'll want to get right.<br /><br />klc;</div>
