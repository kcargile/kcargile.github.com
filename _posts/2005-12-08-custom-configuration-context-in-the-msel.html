summary: If you've been lucky enough to do any development using .NET 2.0 and the CTP of the Enterprise Library 2.0 then you've likely noticed the absence of the Configuration Application Block in the new EL, as well as the new and improved configuration functionality built into the framework. In .NET 2.0 you are not limited to executable projects for built-in access to configuration data via App.Config (or Web.config for that matter).<br />

<div>If you've been lucky enough to do any development using .NET 2.0 and the CTP of the Enterprise Library 2.0 then you've likely noticed the absence of the Configuration Application Block in the new EL, as well as the new and improved configuration functionality built into the framework. In .NET 2.0 you are not limited to executable projects for built-in access to configuration data via App.Config (or Web.config for that matter).<br /><a name='more'></a><br />But if you're still developing using .NET 1.1 and the 1.1 release of the EL and you're building reusable class libraries, then you'll probably want to carry some configuration data around with your assemblies. In this case, storing your configuration information in the hosting process' config file, say Web.config, couples your assembly to the UI and thus undermines portability. Luckily, the Enterprise Library allows you to create custom configuration contexts for just this purpose.<br /><br />You can defined your custom configuration in a few simple steps:<br /><br />1) Define your custom configuration file. For my class libraries, I usually call this App.config for the sake of familiarity. The format of this file is basic XML as with any other .NET configuration file.<br /><br />2) Since the class library won't automatically create the properly named version of the config file, you'll need a post-build event to rename the file and move it to the correct place. You could also just name the file this way to begin with, but I personally like to have my config files in \bin and I generally prefer not to check items in \bin into source control. In any event, my post-build script contains something like this:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>copy "..\..\Configuration\App.config" ".\MyNamespace.MyApp.dll.config"</code></pre>3) Now you simply need to get a reference to the new config file at runtime. I typically put this somewhere global (but internal) to my application so that its easily accessible. For example:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>private const string AppConfigFileName = "MyNamespace.MyApp.dll.config";
<br />private static ConfigurationContext _cfgCtx = null;
<br />
<br />internal static ConfigurationContext ConfigContext
<br />{
<br />  get
<br />  {
<br />    if (_cfgCtx == null)
<br />    {
<br />      string assmCodeBase = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().CodeBase;
<br />      string assmPath = assmCodeBase.Remove(0, 8);
<br />      assmPath = assmPath.Substring(0, assmPath.LastIndexOf('/'));
<br />      string configPath = assmPath + "/" + AppConfigFileName;
<br />
<br />      _cfgCtx = ConfigurationManager.CreateContext(configPath);
<br />    }
<br />
<br />    return _cfgCtx;
<br />  }
<br />}</code></pre>One of the great, relatively unknown features of the Enterprise Library is that each of the Application Block factories will let you pass in a custom configuration context in as an argument exactly for this purpose. So now when you need to, say, handle an exception, you instantiate the ExceptionPolicy like so:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>bool rethrow = ExceptionPolicy.HandleException(e, "Data", ConfigContext);</code></pre>And that's all it takes. Each of the other blocks works in much the same way, allowing you to instrument your reusable assemblies independently of one another and independent from whatever process might be hosting them.<br /><br /><a href="http://cdn.kriscargile.com/samples/custommselconfig.zip">custommselconfig.zip</a><br /><br />klc;</div>
