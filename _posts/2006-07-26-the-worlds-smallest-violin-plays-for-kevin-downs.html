summary: Microsoft's forthcoming Sandcastle and the now (officially) defunct NDoc project have been on a lot of people's minds lately. I'm personally big into documentation, and any tool that can help me to this end are invaluable. It's an added bonus if they're free.<br /><br />Those of you who share this philosophy have probably been following NDoc's progress since the 2.0 release of .NET. It's unfortunate the way things have progressed. But as the owner of two open source projects myself, I've held quite a bit of sympathy for NDoc's creator, Kevin Downs, because of the flack he was taking from the .NET community. Open source development is, unfortunately, an often thankless persuit.<br />

<div>Microsoft's forthcoming Sandcastle and the now (officially) defunct NDoc project have been on a lot of people's minds lately. I'm personally big into documentation, and any tool that can help me to this end are invaluable. It's an added bonus if they're free.<br /><br />Those of you who share this philosophy have probably been following NDoc's progress since the 2.0 release of .NET. It's unfortunate the way things have progressed. But as the owner of two open source projects myself, I've held quite a bit of sympathy for NDoc's creator, Kevin Downs, because of the flack he was taking from the .NET community. Open source development is, unfortunately, an often thankless persuit.<br />I was sympathetic, that is, until I read the email he released today officially announcing the end of the NDoc project.<br /><br />You should know that I don't know Kevin Downs. I've never met him. He's probably a hell of a guy, and without question has contributed more to open-source .NET development than most of us ever will. But it's a little hard to feel sorry for someone that rants with no real good reason.<br /><br />In case you haven't seen the email, here are a few examples of what I'm talking about:<br /><br />Downs says: "<em>Unfortunately, despite the almost ubiquitous use of NDoc, there has been no support for the project from the .Net developer community either financially or by development contributions."</em><br /><br />A quick look through the lists on NDoc's SourceForge website will show you that people have literally been begging to help with NDoc since the release of .NET 2.0. Downs just won't let anyone help. I guess sometimes it's just too hard to let go of your baby.<br /><br />Then, <em>"In fact, were it not for Oleg Tkachenko's kind donation of a MS MVP MSDN subscription, I would not even have a copy of VS2005 to work with!"</em><br /><br />Yeah, that's tough. Sometimes we do actually have to pay for software. It's shitty, I know, but what are you going to do? I guess you could create an open-source...oh, nevermind. Wait, Eclipse is still free, isn't it?<br /><br />And, <em>"...there are some in the community who believe that a .Net 2.0 compatible release was theirs by-right and that I should be moving faster..."</em><br /><br />Point well taken. You don't owe us anything. Just like we don't owe you anything. Free-will is a beautiful thing, my friend.<br /><br />And finally, <em>"Once 'Sandcastle' is released, it is my belief that it will become the de-facto standard and that NDoc will slowly become a stagnant side-water."</em><br /><br />All-right! Way to throw in the towel!<br /><br />The simple fact is, if financial gain is your primary goal, you probably shouldn't invest your time in an open-source project. There are many other, more compelling reasons to do so. Besides, there's no lack of paying work out there. That said, I find it hard to believe that Downs didn't at least have the opportunity to profit from his creation. A project as successful and ubiquitous as NDoc would almost surely open doors to other opportunities: consulting, writing, training, and so on. Squandering these is simply a matter of poor business skills - it has nothing to do with the rest of us. At the very least, the fame alone should be an almost priceless asset. That is unless you piss it away with a bunch of whiny, arrogant, misleading garbage.<br /><br />So, hats off to Kevin for all of his hard work over the past few years and a genuine, heartfelt thanks for a great piece of software. We all hate to see you go. Really.<br /><br />Now pass the torch and shut up.<br /><br />klc;</div>
