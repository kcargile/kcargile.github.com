summary: It seems that, starting sometime today, Google began attempting to install the QuickTime player controls into browsers visiting websites with Google's AdSense content displayed. This appears to be the case even if the website owner has chosen to only display text ads on the site.<br /><br />As this stinks a bit of adware, I have to believe that it may be the proverbial straw for many AdSense subscribers.<br />

Oh yeah, and, WTF?!?!<br /><br />klc;</div>
