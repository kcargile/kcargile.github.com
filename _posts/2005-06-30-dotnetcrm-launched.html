summary: Over the past few years, I've worked on a variety of CRM projects. Most of these projects have involved custom solutions, which clients perceive will cost less than an off-the-shelf product (which is rarely the case). Some of these projects have involved commercial products, and many of these projects have fizzled due to budget or resource constraints. Almost all of these contain nearly the same features and functionality. I've learned quite a bit about how end-users use CRMs, what their expectations are, and how these systems must integrate into the enterprise.<br />

<div>Over the past few years, I've worked on a variety of CRM projects. Most of these projects have involved custom solutions, which clients perceive will cost less than an off-the-shelf product (which is rarely the case). Some of these projects have involved commercial products, and many of these projects have fizzled due to budget or resource constraints. Almost all of these contain nearly the same features and functionality. I've learned quite a bit about how end-users use CRMs, what their expectations are, and how these systems must integrate into the enterprise.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />I've decided to launch a new, open-source CRM project. My vision is to build a totally free, open system that is standards-based, highly secure, performant, and extensible. We'll be making heavy use of web services, design patterns, and test-driven-development. If this sounds interesting and you'd like to contribute please contact me.<br /><br />We're still in the early planning stages, but I expect development to start fairly soon. Keep on eye on my blog for more info, or check out the project details on SourceForge at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetcrm/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetcrm/</a>. The official project website, <a href="http://www.dotnetcrm.org" target="_blank">http://www.dotnetcrm.org</a>, should be up in the next few days.<br /><br />klc;</div>
