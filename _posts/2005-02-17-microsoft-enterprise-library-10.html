summary: I'm a big fan of simplicity. I'm also a big fan of high-quality, high-performance, and scalability. And if you are developing enterprise-scale software using MS.NET you can gain a leg-up in all of these fronts by taking advantage of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp">Microsoft's Enterprise Library</a> (EL). The EL, which was developed by the well-respected Patterns and Practices team at Microsoft, rolls together and updates Microsoft's original Application Blocks into a common, extensible, scalable MS.NET API.<br />

<div>I'm a big fan of simplicity. I'm also a big fan of high-quality, high-performance, and scalability. And if you are developing enterprise-scale software using MS.NET you can gain a leg-up in all of these fronts by taking advantage of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp">Microsoft's Enterprise Library</a> (EL). The EL, which was developed by the well-respected Patterns and Practices team at Microsoft, rolls together and updates Microsoft's original Application Blocks into a common, extensible, scalable MS.NET API.<br />If you're not familiar with the Enterprise Library or Application Blocks, they provide reusable chunks of code to help you more easily tackle mundane tasks like logging, exception handling, caching, and cryptography - all the while adhering to best-practice and providing you with liberal opportunity to exploit extensibility. The EL also does a great job of demonstrating another worthy topic: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/002-9528570-7737624">design patterns</a>. It's chock full of facades and factories, and even if you have no use for the functionality in the EL, you could do much worse than to look to it as a best-practice model or learning tool. Best of all, its available for free from Microsoft.<br /><br />How you choose to implement the EL will depend largely on your needs, and in how comfortable coupling to the EL. My usual practice - though my experience with the EL has been very positive - is to wrap the EL's functionality into my own facade classes. That way, major changes to the EL or requirements make replacing underlying functionality relatively transparent to higher layers in the application (as they should be).<br /><br />For example, invoking the EL's ExceptionManager directly looks something like this:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>public class ExceptionProneClass
<br />{
<br />  public void GetSomeSqlData()
<br />  {
<br />    try
<br />    {
<br />      // do some data access
<br />    }
<br />    catch (SqlException ex)
<br />    {
<br />      // Invoke the HandleException EL method
<br />      bool rethrow = ExceptionPolicy.HandleException(ex, "Data Policy");
<br />      if (rethrow)
<br />      {
<br />        throw;
<br />      }
<br />    }
<br />    finally
<br />    {
<br />      // do cleanup
<br />    }
<br />  }
<br />}</code></pre>The wrapper class, albeit only subtly different, looks like this:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>// facade for exception management
<br />public class ExceptionManager
<br />{
<br />  const string DEFAULT_POLICY_NAME = "Standard";
<br />
<br />  public static void ProcessException(Exception ex)
<br />  {
<br />    ProcessException(ex, DEFAULT_POLICY_NAME);
<br />  }
<br />
<br />  public static void ProcessException(Exception ex, string p)
<br />  {
<br />    bool rethrow = ExceptionPolicy.HandleException(ex, p);
<br />    if (rethrow)
<br />    {
<br />      throw;
<br />    }
<br />  }
<br />
<br />  public static void ProcessException(Exception ex, ExceptionPolicyType p)
<br />  {
<br />    Type t = typeof(ExceptionPolicyType);
<br />    ProcessException(ex, Enum.GetName(t, (int)p));
<br />  }
<br />}</code></pre><br />Now our original class can be refactored to call our facade method(s) instead of referencing the EL directly. This simplifies our call to the EL ExceptionManager even more, by allowing our own class to handle rethrowing exceptions as necessary, letting us enumerate exception policy names, etc.<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>public class MyExceptionProneClass
<br />{
<br />  public void GetSomeSqlData()
<br />  {
<br />    try
<br />    {
<br />      // do some data access
<br />    }
<br />    catch (SqlException ex)
<br />    {
<br />      // Invoke our exception handler facade
<br />      ExceptionManager.ProcessException(ex, "Data Policy");
<br />    }
<br />    finally
<br />    {
<br />      // cleanup
<br />    }
<br />  }
<br />}</code></pre><br />I often follow this pattern for each of the application blocks. This might appear to undermine the time-saving advantages of the Enterprise Library, and in some cases it does. But in others - a major shift in an application's authentication and/or authorization scheme, for example - saves a costly refactor because you're too tightly coupled to the EL (or perhaps because you weren't using it at all). Granted, making a case against this isn't terribly difficult (though doing so would be substantially un-agile), but I've seen this happen at least once since the latest version of the EL was released in January.<br /><br /><a href="http://cdn.kriscargile.com/samples/msel-facades.zip">msel-facades.zip</a><br /><br />klc;</div>
