<div>I just talked to some folks at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/presentation/" target="_blank">Avalon</a> Lounge here at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/" target="_blank">PDC</a> about Sparkle. Here's the dialog:<br /><br />KC: Can you tell me about Sparkle?<br />MSFT: There is information about Sparkle, but I cannot share it with you. Check back tomorrow afternoon.<br />KC: Are you suggesting that Sparkle will be announced at tomorrow's keynote?<br />MSFT: I can't answer that question sir. You're spilling your beer on my shoes.<br /><br />So, it would appear that the rumors are true. Microsoft will be officially announcing Sparkle here at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/" target="_blank">PDC</a>, presumably at tomorrow's keynote.<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/12.html#a11121" target="_blank"> Robert Scoble blogged about Sparkle yesterday</a>, and <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/jd/archives/2005/09/scoble_on_spark.cfm" target="_blank">Macromedia appears tobepositioning based on his reaction</a> to a pre-release demo. It will be interesting to see how things pan out,specifically which toolkit Sparkle will fall into.<br /><br />Check back here or see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/" target="_blank">PDC</a> website for more information tomorrow afternoon.<br /><br />klc;</div>
