<div><strong>Why Use a Configuration Manager?</strong><br /><br />In enterprise application development, loose coupling between tiers is paramount to building a reusable, extensible solution. One of the best ways to enforce loose coupling is to make sure that the lower layers (i.e. tiers) of an application are unaware of those on top of it. Its this idea that has spawned the event-heavy paradigm available in contemporary programming languages.<br /><br />In MS.NET, we have a few different options for persisting and retrieving configuration data for an application. Probably the most familiar is the ubiquitous configuration file, but there's a host of other ways to store this information: as simple text, as xml, or in the Windows registry. Regardless of how you choose to store this information, however, it is likely that you will need to make it available throughout your application. This means that accessing a domain specific configuration file  say web.config  directly from other layers violates the concept of loose coupling and undermines encapsulation. Plus, there is no guarantee that the application requiring configuration data will be executing under a specific context (HttpContext, for example).<br />This means that, in the case of an n-tier application where business objects may be used by multiple user-interfaces, we cannot rely on intrinsic access to configuration files. You'll have to decide whether to roll your own configuration schema, manually parse the configuration files, or use some other configuration tool like the Windows registry or the Microsoft Enterprise Library Configuration Application Block.<br /><br />In any event, we need an architecture that facilitates these requirements, while allowing us easy, efficient access to our configuration data. Enter the singleton configuration manager.<br /><br /><strong>The Singleton Pattern</strong><br /><br />Singleton is a design pattern made famous by the so-called Gang of Four in Design Patterns. Essentially, singleton is used to ensure that one and only one instance of an object ever exists in memory. This pattern works very nicely for classes whose data is the same for all users of an application, especially if this data changes infrequently  in these cases there is little justification for the overhead of instantiating the same object over and over. For retrieving static configuration data, singleton is a perfect fit.<br /><br /><strong>Project Setup</strong><br /><br />For the sake of simplicity, the sample solution includes only the configuration manager project, a simple web project, and a sample registry merge file.

The singleton pattern is very easy to implement: make the constructor private, add a static member variable to hold the sole instance of the class, and create an Instance method to return this member. Its also good practice to implement a lock anytime you are accessing a static member:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>public class ConfigurationManager
<br />{
<br />  private static volatile ConfigurationManager _instance = null;
<br />  private static object _instanceLock = new object();
<br />
<br />  public static ConfigurationManager Instance()
<br />  {
<br />    if (_instance == null)
<br />    {
<br />      lock (_instanceLock)
<br />      {
<br />        if (_instance == null)
<br />        {
<br />          _instance = new ConfigurationManager();
<br />        }
<br />      }
<br />    }
<br />    return _instance;
<br />  }
<br />}
<br /></code></pre>Now that we have the foundation for our singleton in place, all we need to do is implement accessors to retrieve our properties from the appropriate location. In this example, Im using the Windows registry:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>public sealed class ConfigurationManager
<br />{
<br />  private const string mConnectionString = “ConnectionString”;
<br />  private const string mAppRegKey = “SOFTWARE\\bettersoftwarenow\\samples\\configurationManager”;
<br />  private static volatile ConfigurationManager _instance = null;
<br />  private static object _instanceLock = new object();
<br />
<br />  public String DbConnectionString
<br />  {
<br />    get
<br />    {
<br />      String cnString = null;
<br />      cnString = (string)GetObjectValueFromRegistrg(mConnectionString);
<br />      return cnString;
<br />    }
<br />  }
<br />
<br />  public static ConfigurationManager Instance()
<br />  {
<br />    if (_instance == null)
<br />    {
<br />      lock (_instanceLock)
<br />      {
<br />        if (_instance == null)
<br />        {
<br />          _instance = new ConfigurationManager();
<br />        }
<br />      }
<br />    }
<br />    return _instance;
<br />  }
<br />
<br />  private object GetObjectValueFromRegistry(string valueName)
<br />  {
<br />    object regValue = null;
<br />    using (RegistryKey regKey = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(
<br />      ConfigurationManager.mAppRegKey))
<br />    {
<br />      if (regKey != null)
<br />      {
<br />        regValue = regKey.GetValue(valueName);
<br />        regKey.Close();
<br />      }
<br />      else
<br />      {
<br />        regValue = null;
<br />      }
<br />    }
<br />    return regValue;
<br />  }
<br />}
<br /></code></pre>To access the ConfigurationManager from anywhere else in the solution, you just instantiate using the static Instance method. You can then use the class just like you would any other, except that future calls to instance will return a reference to the instance already in memory:<br /><pre class="kccodeblock"><code>public class _Default : Page
<br />{
<br />  private ConfigurationManager _config = ConfigurationManager.Instance();
<br />
<br />  private void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
<br />  {
<br />    if (!IsPostBack)
<br />    {
<br />      string cnString = _config.DbConnectionString;
<br />      // code to use db connection string
<br />    }
<br />  }
<br />
<br />  // remainder of class ommited
<br />}
<br /></code></pre><br />Using a single point to retrieve configuration information will make your application far more flexible, will help eliminate duplication of this data across layers, and will prevent tight coupling between your applications tiers. Building this functionality using a singleton design pattern adds an element of simplicity to your application, while yielding a small performance advantage at runtime.<br /><br />klc;</div>
