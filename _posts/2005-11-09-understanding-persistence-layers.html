summary: I've always been a big fan of using a persistence layer to map persistent data to business objects in enterprise systems. And as with most other things, I've found this to be an area of passionate debate among other developers, and  as with most other things  its often a hard sell. In any case, I've found that using a dedicated mapping layer will significantly reduce coupling, greatly enhance extensibility, and reduce the costs of maintenance in my applications.<br />

<div>I've always been a big fan of using a persistence layer to map persistent data to business objects in enterprise systems. And as with most other things, I've found this to be an area of passionate debate among other developers, and  as with most other things  its often a hard sell. In any case, I've found that using a dedicated mapping layer will significantly reduce coupling, greatly enhance extensibility, and reduce the costs of maintenance in my applications.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />There are two main approaches to implementing a persistence layer COTS O/R packages (like the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp" target="_blank">DAAB</a>)or rolling your own  and each has its pros and cons. But regardless of which route you choose, its important to have a solid fundamental understanding of how a persistence layer works, and why you'd want one to begin with. I recently ran across another of Scott Ambler's whitepapers while searching for some empirical ammunition against my skeptical colleagues, <em>The Design of a Robust Persistence Layer for Relational Databases</em>, that does an excellent job of explaining the basic architecture and reasoning behind persistence layers (complete with the correct application of contemporary design patterns like Proxy and Singleton).<br /><br />Take a few minutes to read Scott's whitepaper at <a href="http://www.ambysoft.com/downloads/persistenceLayer.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ambysoft.com/downloads/persistenceLayer.pdf</a>.<br /><br />klc;</div>
