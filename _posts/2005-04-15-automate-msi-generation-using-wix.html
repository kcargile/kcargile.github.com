<div>Automated build tools like <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">NAnt</a> can streamline your build process and alleviate some of the headaches of team integration. But using these tools to build a Setup and Deployment project is another story  its impossible to build a setup project using csc, and the MSI task in <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">NAnt</a> leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Enter <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/" target="_blank">WiX</a>, an XML-based, scriptable, toolset originally developed by Microsoft that can be used to automate the build of an MSI. Using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/" target="_blank">WiX</a>, part of the output from your build can be an up-to-date installer for your product.<br /><br />While extremely powerful and flexible, WiX is also somewhat of an enigma. Its fairly complex and not very well documented. But not to worry  Microsoft installer guru Rob Mensching has published an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/smartclient/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwingen/html/wixsetup.asp" target="_blank">excellent article</a> on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com" target="_blank">MSDN</a> explaining how <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/" target="_blank">WiX</a> works and how you can use it in your build process.<br /><br />klc;</div>
