<div>For the two of you that have noticed I'm out of town again, I've spent the last two days in the ScrumMaster Certification course in Richmond, VA. I was initiallya bit disappointed that Scrum co-founder Ken Schwaber was unable to lead the class (word has it that his recovery is going well), though subs Kert Peterson and Jim York have done an excellent job (the quality of the venue chosen for the class has left much to be desired, however).<br /><br />In any event, its been a very interesting and fast-moving course, and the pragmatic insights into what makes Scrum succeed (or fail) have been highly valuable. I'd recommend ScrumMaster training for anyone who is considering implementing Agile in their organization or who wants to bring Agile to the table as a consultant/vendor.<br /><br />You can learn more about Scrum at <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org" target="_blank">http://www.scrumalliance.org</a> or <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com" target="_blank">http://www.controlchaos.com</a>.<br /><br />klc;</div>
