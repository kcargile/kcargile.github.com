Other than a wait of over four hours to check in at the Wilshire Grand (which incidentally, isn't very), things kicked off pretty smoothly. Thanks to Michael Herman of <a href="http://www.parallelspace.net/" target="_blank">Parallelspace</a> for sharing his dinner table with me and for the great tips on getting the most from the conference.<br /><br />In any event, gurus <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutlet.aspx" target="_blank">Don Box</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg" target="_blank">Anders Hejlsberg</a> gave an excellent demonstration of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/building/presentation/" target="_blank">Avalon</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/indigo/" target="_blank">Indigo</a> during this mornings keynote, which included a visit from none other than, you guessed it, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/" target="_blank">Napoleon Dynamite</a>.<br /><br />klc;</div>
