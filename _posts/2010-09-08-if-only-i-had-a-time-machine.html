<div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div>Photography has been a serious addiction of mine for more years than I'm willing to admit. It's been long enough to see 110 come and go, slide film fizzle, and $19 disposable digital cameras on the counter at CVS. Not too many years ago, a digital camera with a resolution high enough for anything you'd show to your mother required the budget of the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog team. And if you wanted to keep any of those shots for more than a few minutes, you'd probably also want a sizable SCSI hard drive array, a DAT with a big box of tapes, and a corporate Iron Mountain account.<br />Those of us who were still working with chemicals had to get a little more creative. I went to great lenghts to store my film: a fireproof file cabinet rated for volcanic temperatures, hanging organizers made of space age polymers, and boxes of hard-to-find labels that faded overnight and never seemed to stay put. A true labor of love. &nbsp; <br />But in the end, it doesn't really matter if you're the guy with the massive expense account or you're just trying to keep shit organized at home. Anyone who's created something that can't be replaced, at least not without &nbsp;some serious pain, would certainly go to great lenghts to protect it, right? Turns out there are plenty of people out there betting that's the case. It's why RackSpace bought JungleDisk, why Carbonite runs commercials during Hannah Montana reruns (yeah, you watch 'em), and probably what helps keep the lights on at Collab.<br />Um, Collab? That's right. Because programmers don't need all that insulting, thirty second prime-time encouragement. We know better. We take the time to create regular backups, image our machines, check our changes in every day, clean out the cat box, and merge carefully. Yeah, not so fast there Josey.<br />Maybe it's just me, but what's with all these "senior" developers out there who never seemed to figure out the whole version control thing? Are there really teams out there working on eight year long projects, staffed by people that never make mistakes, using computers that never crash, working in buildings that never burn down? Horseshit. I just worked with a guy who told me that he was considering a move to SharePoint or BizTalk, because he had "mastered .NET" and was bored. Fascinating. I asked him to connect to TFS and pull the tips for our project, and he looked at me like I was a fucking alien. I literally had to teach this guy how to use TFS, despite his nine years of experience.<br />Fact is, most people never think to ask about version control in an interview. No one's ever asked me, anyway. And it's a huge mistake. Version control is as fundamental to a modern team project as recursion, pointers, big-O, 3NF, and breathing. Still not convinced? Consider the following:<br />People without version control experience have probably never been part of a real &nbsp;software team. Bits aren't delivered in cardboard file boxes stuffed full of punch cards any more. A team can't build software without some kind of central repository.<br />Developers that resist version control usually don't think in terms of reuse. You probably shouldn't expect much in the way of componentization, commoditization, craftsmanship, or writing abiilty.<br />Version control promotes visibility and accountabilty. Programmers who refuse to commit daily or who insist on "checking in at the end when everything is ready," are hiding something. Maybe it's their inability to grasp the true &nbsp;value of the very thing they're building, maybe it's their ignorance, or maybe it's the fact that they lied to you about how far along they are. It doesn't matter, you're fucked no matter what.<br />Constant checkins demonstrate pride of ownership. It's just like doing a feature spot in Penthouse Magazine. Look all you want asshole, that shit is good and you know it. Besides...<br />...it passed the automated build. Automated builds promote quality, and automated builds need version control. &nbsp;And people who are passionate about automated build processes are usually religious about quality.<br />One person on the team who doesn't understand version control will wreck productivity for those people on the team who do. It might not happen immediately, &nbsp;but it will happen eventually, mark my words.<br />OK, you just graduated from college and nobody bothered to mention it. Fine, I get it.<br /><div><br /></div></div>
