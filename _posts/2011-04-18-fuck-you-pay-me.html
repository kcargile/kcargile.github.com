  Mule Design Studio co-founder Mike Monteiro leads a poignant and gratuitously profane talk on the importance of contracts and legal representation for freelancers and consultants. His perspective is–not surprisingly–that of a designer, but his message aptly transcends disciplines. If you've ever worked without a contract, inked a client agreement sans second thought, or wondered exactly how to deal with that asshole that can never seem to find his checkbook, you absolutely <b>MUST</b> see this.<br />
