<div>If you've spent much time around developers, you know that we can be pretty hard-headed (me especially). Personally, I've found myself in many heated arguments about why I think (or require, if I can) that its best to not use DataSets in web applications. These debates almost always lead to a complex and passionate white-boarding session, after which everyone leaves unconvinced. Like I said, we're a hard-headed bunch.<br /><br />Thankfully, ASP.NET guru <a href="http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/" target="_blank">Scott Mitchell</a> has posted an <a href="http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/050405-1.aspx" target="_blank">excellent article on 4GuysFromRolla</a> that tactfully outlines the disadvantages of using a DataSet in an ASP.NET application, complete with metrics and references to some other excellent related resources (e.g. binding custom collections).
