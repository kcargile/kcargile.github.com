<div>Apparently, I've been a bit confused about the upcoming changes in the licensing structure for MSDN subscriptions. A quick chat with the nice folks at the MSDN Subscriptions PDC booth left me pleasantly surprised - while the MSDN packages themselves are changing radically, the price increases are only for new MSDN subscribers. Existing subscribers will be grandfathered as long as their subscription does not lapse (and the breaks are even better for volume-license subscribers). This is a fact that Microsoft has done a poor job in marketing - better educating the developer community might have prevented the angry backlash that we're seeing throughout the developer community.<br /><br />Regardless, you can now make other plans for that extra $8000 you've been saving.<br /><br />klc;</div>
