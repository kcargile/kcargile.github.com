summary: Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on several large-scale CMS implementations. My presence on those projects, all at different maturity levels and staffed by teams of widely varying experience, have given me insight into a variety of different approaches and notions about exactly what <em>content management</em> is. But any way you cut it, the core objective of any CMS implementation is always the same: maximize value by enabling non-technical users to manage a website in the friendliest way possible.<br /><br />It makes little difference what platform you choose or what your technological leanings are. Building a CMS is a business-process-driven endeavor, not a technology-driven one. Unfortunately, this tenet is often lost on the teams tasked with a CMS implementation. <br />

<div>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on several large-scale CMS implementations. My presence on those projects, all at different maturity levels and staffed by teams of widely varying experience, have given me insight into a variety of different approaches and notions about exactly what <em>content management</em> is. But any way you cut it, the core objective of any CMS implementation is always the same: maximize value by enabling non-technical users to manage a website in the friendliest way possible.<br /><br />It makes little difference what platform you choose or what your technological leanings are. Building a CMS is a business-process-driven endeavor, not a technology-driven one. Unfortunately, this tenet is often lost on the teams tasked with a CMS implementation. <br /><a name='more'></a><br />There are a handful of reasons why this happens. Most often, it stems from a conceptual disconnect between the innards of a CMS and the patterns typically used to build complex, data-driven websites. That's not to say that there aren't similarities; most contemporary CMS platforms <em>are</em> based on an object-oriented model. It's where this model ultimately exists and how it's managed that can seem counter-intuitive, often inviting needless trouble.<br /><br />There's no question: enterprise-class content management systems are starkly overwhelming. But a skilled developer can easily become a highly effective CMS architect if he's willing to put in the requisite learning time. Here are a few things I've learned&mdashsome the hard way&mdashthat will improve your chances of success on any large CMS project:<br /><br /><strong>Understand the system.</strong> If you've worked in IT for more than a week or so, you probably recognize the irony of this statement. Be that as it may, you're going to have to push back if you haven't been given ample time for research if you expect to deliver anything of appreciable quality. Consultants take note: if you've been tasked with making a recommendation, get ready to hit the books. You'll need to understand <em>many</em> systems in an ever expanding pool of offerings. Regardless of which path you're on, it is absolutely critical that you understand what your CMS can and cannot do, what features and facilities are available in it, and how these apply to solving real-world problems. Remember, the designers of the CMS have already solved most of your problems&mdashtaxonomy, workflow, rendering, security, syndication, and aggregation&mdashfor you. Not having a solid, expert-level understanding of your chosen CMS will result in undue heartache and overtime, I promise.<br /><br /><strong>Understand the business.</strong> This might seem like a given, but its a step that is too often discounted. Unlike a simple, static website that is maintained by a development team, by its very nature a CMS must mirror internal business processes and organizational structure. A CMS really serves two types of users: the eventual consumers of the website <em>and</em> those who are responsible for creating, editing, and publishing content. Careful understanding of how the latter operates, how they are organized, and what impact the CMS workflow will have on their job is critical to designing the system correctly. Consider hiring a business analyst with CMS implementation experience if your development team is overburdened or isn't up to the task. <br /><br /><strong>Understand fully the implications of customizing the system.</strong> As software developers, we're sometimes quick to assume that writing more code is the best way to solve a problem. Yet in all but the most complex CMS deployments, it's rare to have to write any code at all. And a cavalier approach here will almost lead to trouble. For instance, extra steps must be taken to ensure that custom code is compatible with the CMS' internal workings including intrinsic editing tools and the publishing process, and that it can be localized from within the CMS. Such code also further complicates builds, increases your vulnerability to breaking changes introduced by upgrades, and often requires substantial regression testing. If you have to add to the code base, make damn sure your code is compatible, well-tested, and that it is well integrated into build process.<br /><br /><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help.</strong> There's no shame in asking for help. Your CMS vendor or development community likely has some very sharp folks who are there to provide guidance. Many commercial products have formal training or certification programs, and there are experienced consultants out there who can help. Any way you look at it, it's money well spent.<br /><br />Not unlike most other projects, your success will ultimately be determined by how well you understand the software you're using and how well you can apply it to a particular organization's needs. Though a different kind of beast, designing and deploying a content management system can be a particularly rewarding (and fun) pursuit.<br /><br />Happy publishing!<br /><br />klc;</div>
