<div>I just left this morning's keynote to take an emergency call from my wife (her iPod wouldn't boot). Thankfully, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/" target="_blank">Eric Rudder</a> had already announced Expression, Microsoft's entry in to the design world. The Expression team gave a whirlwind demo of the tools, which include Acrylic, a raster/vector graphics editing tool; Sparkle, a vector animation tool; and Quartz, a webdesign/layout tool. Each application makes heavy use of <a href="http://www.xaml.net/" target="_blank">XAML</a>, uses the MS-Build engine internally,and output integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio 2005.<br /><br />I'm very interested in the reaction from the design community, as acceptance of these products would significantly streamline the developer-designer workflow.<br /><br />You can read more about Expression in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/news_and_press/press_2005-09-14.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft's official press release</a>.<br /><br />klc;</div>
