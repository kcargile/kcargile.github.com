summary: I just finished up a small web-service oriented project, and probably would have pulled all of my hair out had it not been for two great debugging tools. The first, <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/2005-12-12-debugging-web-services.html#XmlSerializerPreCompiler" target="_blank">Chris Sells' XmlPrecompiler,</a> is a command-line tool that mimics .NET's serialization of classes and helps you tackle any cryptic error messages returned to you by the serializer. The second is a <a href="http://www.cybral.com/downloads/XmlPreCompiler.zip" target="_blank">WinForms front-end for Sells' tool</a> developed by the folks at Cybral. If you are relying on .NET's Xml serializer to proxy complex classes for you, then I highly recommend that you get these tools -they are a lifesaver.<br />

This message means that serializer was unable to dynamically generate an assembly containing the serialized type. There are a few explanations for this floating around out there in the Internet, none of which solved my issue. It turns out that the compilation errors the serializer was experiencing were directly related to the complexity of my class (specifically, the operator overloads). Once I simplified the structure of my class, the serializer ran perfectly.<br /><br />klc;</div>
