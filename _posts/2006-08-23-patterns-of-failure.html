summary: In many professional disciplines&mdash;programming, architecture, design, and so on&mdash;design patterns often provide a handy way to tackle a specific, well-defined task. When used correctly, they can save countless hours of mundane, boring tedium. Life is good.<br /><br />As a generally optimistic and analytical bunch, humans tend to think of patterns in this regard. But that's not to say that that all patterns are good. Bad patterns can, and often do, unravel hours of hard, high-quality work, whether you're building software or pressure washing a driveway. So very often, these have little to do with technology, engineering, or the most basic human logic.<br />

<div>In many professional disciplines&mdash;programming, architecture, design, and so on&mdash;design patterns often provide a handy way to tackle a specific, well-defined task. When used correctly, they can save countless hours of mundane, boring tedium. Life is good.<br /><br />As a generally optimistic and analytical bunch, humans tend to think of patterns in this regard. But that's not to say that that all patterns are good. Bad patterns can, and often do, unravel hours of hard, high-quality work, whether you're building software or pressure washing a driveway. So very often, these have little to do with technology, engineering, or the most basic human logic.<br />I stumbled across an old, yet still pertinent, post on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ssargent/" target="_blank">Scott Saregent's blog</a> this morning that reminded me of how little we actually learn from the past. Chaos it would seem, is timeless.<br /><br />So if you haven't already seen it, read up on the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ssargent/archive/2003/12/02/40735.aspx" target="_blank">Firefighter Pattern</a>. Chances are, you've been working with it for years and don't even know it.<br /><br />klc;</div>
