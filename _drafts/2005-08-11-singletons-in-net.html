  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div>I've received a number of emails in response to my <em>Creating a Singleton Configuration Manager</em> article that appeared on ASP.NET a few weeks ago, many asking about the Singleton pattern and how best to implement it in .NET. Since this has beena pretty common question, I thought I'd share the answer that I've been giving with everyone:<br /><br />First, if you're new to design patterns, there are several good books out there to read. The most ubiquitous (and the one that I consistently recommend), however, is Gamma et al's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=kriscargileco-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;camp=1789&amp;link_code=ur2&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0201633612/qid=1115041347/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>. One reader also recommended an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpatterns/html/ImpSingletonInCsharp.asp" target="_blank">excellent article on MSDN</a> that lays out the Singleton pattern in .NET, complete with code samples and explanation of associated multithreading issues.<br /><br />These two resources should give you all you need to get a Singleton class up and running correctly in .NET.<br /><br />klc;</div>
