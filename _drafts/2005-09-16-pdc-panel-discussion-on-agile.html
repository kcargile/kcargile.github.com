  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div>I was surprised at the big turnout for the Advances in Agile Development PDC session today. I was also happy to see that <a href="http://www.nunit.org/" target="_blank">NUnit</a> creator <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/" target="_blank">James Newkirk</a> was part of the five member panel of experts (read Newkirk's blog entry outlining his PDC involvement <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/archive/2005/09/08/462547.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>).<br /><br />The discussion, which consisted mostly of a Q&amp;A session, seemed to steer towards Microsoft's use of XP internally by the Patterns and Practices team and the feasibility of agile for distributed teams. For some reason, I was expecting to hear more about Microsoft's new adaptation of MSF for agile projects, but no such luck.<br /><br />In any case, it's good to see that larger organizations like Microsoft are successfully implementing agile techniques on large projects, an area that the naysayers commonly argue against.<br /><br />klc;</div>
