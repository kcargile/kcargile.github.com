summary: <a href="http://www.dougrohm.com">Doug Rohm</a> has given me a lot of grief over the last year or so about not giving his favorite Visual Studio plugin, CodeRush, a fair chance. Instead, despite its painfully slow startup times and sometimes quirky behavior, I've been using JetBrain's Resharper and have been fairly happy with it. Besides, I could never get CodeRush to install correctly on my laptop&mdash;probably not the fault of CodeRush itself but frustrating nonetheless.<br />

  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><a href="http://www.dougrohm.com">Doug Rohm</a> has given me a lot of grief over the last year or so about not giving his favorite Visual Studio plugin, CodeRush, a fair chance. Instead, despite its painfully slow startup times and sometimes quirky behavior, I've been using JetBrain's Resharper and have been fairly happy with it. Besides, I could never get CodeRush to install correctly on my laptop&mdash;probably not the fault of CodeRush itself but frustrating nonetheless.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The past few months, however, have stated to reshape my opinion of Resharper. Working with SQL scripts in Visual Studio seems to confuse Resharper, eventually causing it to throw an exception and usually requiring a restart. Likewise for complex, supposedly "invalid" ASPX pages&mdash;usually those containing inline code&mdash;often cause Resharper to throw exceptions with such wild abandon that Visual Studio eventually crashes (hope you saved recently.)<br /><br />But because its pretty uncommon to run across these types of files, I figured I'd just disable Resharper while I worked with them. I figured wrong. You can't <em>really</em> turn it off. Almost any hotkey combination&mdash;say CTRL + SPACE&mdash;causes Resharper to reactivate itself, painful startup time included. Unacceptable. If I wanted software to take over my computer I'd just install AOL.<br /><br />So, I've decided to retire Resharper. I guess I'll just have to get used to working without it. Maybe I'll see if I can finally get CodeRush to install. Happy, Doug?<br /><br />klc;</div>
