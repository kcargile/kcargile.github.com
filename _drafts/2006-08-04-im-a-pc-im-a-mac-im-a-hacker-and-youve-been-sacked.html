summary: Whether you fall into the PC camp, the Mac camp, or could care less, you have to admit that Apple's recent "I'm a PC, I'm a Mac" ad campaign is pretty funny.

It's doubtful that a hacker cares whether you're a PC or a Mac when he's lifting your credit card number or keylogging your ETrade password. And Apple is doing its customers a great disservice by misleading them into believing that they are immune from these types of attacks.<br /><br />Case-in-point: Jon Ellch and David Maynor have recently <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/8/2/4856">demonstrated how OSX can be hijacked in under one minute</a>.<br /><br />Now might be a good time to patch-up. Use the hard line.<br /><br />klc;</div>
