  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><div><br />In the mid 1990s, just on the heels of Jeff Bezos' launch of Amazon.com, Microsoft bought a small California-based startup called eShop. The team at eShop, which somewhat ironically included would-be eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, had built a spiffy online shopping application called Plaza. Rechristened "Merchant Server" and again later as "Site Server" by Microsoft, Plaza was Redmond's answer to Netscape's Commerce Server, which was shipping at the time and generating respectable interest. More importantly however, the acquisition marked Microsoft's entry into the rapidly accelerating area of business-to-consumer ecommerce, and would set the stage for a whole suite of other esoteric platform offerings, a lineup that would eventually include SharePoint.<br /><br />After several years of refactoring and refinement, Site Server came to the end of its useful life. To it's credit, Site Server 3.0 was a fairly workable platform, and it received some positive acclaim from those tech press types who review such things without every really using them. Most of the time though, it was a horrid pain in the ass to work with.<br /><br />Anyway, in the end, Site Server had amassed a handful of pretty serious features, content management, search, order management, and site personalization the highlights. And almost all of Site Server's big features would evolve into their own enterprise-class platforms. Web content management was spun off into Content Management Server, the commerce pieces into Commerce Server (Netscape's product of the same name was now defunct), and collaboration and personalization became SharePoint. A bunch of obscure and clunky connector libraries suddenly appeared to connect the now disparate pieces, so you could still have managed content in your storefront for example, all of which had previously been a relatively cohesive unit. Two steps forward, three steps backwards.<br /><br />Back to the future. Content Management Server is now part of SharePoint (that "MOSS" thing), Commerce Server is still around but hasn't been much of a contender, and the rest of the old Site Server functionality has evolved into a bazillion other products. Not that this evolutionary path has been a bad thing. Some of the spin-offs made pretty good sense, at least to me, and I'm sure they all made perfect sense to some program manager in a fancy corner office in Washington. But I think that just maybe, this wildly circuitous route might well explain what SharePoint is today: a gigantic goddamn mess.<br /><br />To be fair, there are some things that SharePoint does exceptionally well, like managing documents, connecting to SAP via BizTalk, or integrating tighly with AD. Or creating a team project site if you're unlucky enough to be using TFS. Even the pedestrian looking collaboration portals aren't that bad, assuming that you're not dealing with a highly sophisticated user base. Instead, the real problem is SharePoint's substantial identity crisis, a shortcoming that ripples visibly through almost every aspect of the product. Even Microsoft's own consultants, at least the couple I've asked, can't quantify SharePoint. "I dunno, it does all kinds of stuff, right?" is the kind of answer you might hear.<br /><br />So what have I learned over the past six months of wrestling with SharePoint? If you're looking for a simple Internet-facing CMS, think very carefully before you stroke that six-figure check. Here are some of the bigger battles we've had to fight:<br /><br /><b>Cost</b>. SharePoint is really, really expensive, especially when you look at the big picture. To do it right you're going to need three or four servers running the SharePoint Server components, an SQL Server Enterprise cluster, and a domain controller cluster, at the very minimum. Tack on more boxes for things like a development enviroment, automated builds, QA, reporting, indexing, BizTalk, hosting web services, and so on. Once you add up the cost of all the licenses and hardware necessary to make this work, you'll be looking at an astoundingly large number. Also, since SharePoint development now happens on the workstation (yaay!), the hardware your team is using now may not cut it. There's no arguing that this is a good thing, but expect to spend some money buying new tricked-out workstations if you're not using 64 bit machines. Trust me, it will be excruciatingly painful if you try to get by on the minimum requirements, and developers will waste no time in letting you know.<br /><br />As a matter of non-scientific comparison, a product like SiteCore will land you in the $25k ballpark and includes most of the same content management features that you'd get with SharePoint. An open source platform like DotNetNuke or Umbraco will set you back around $0 plus infrastructure costs, albeit with some extra development dollars necessary to get to the finish. And all of these can be hosted in a fairly straight-forward environment. Not a totally fair comparison I know, but still, there's a long way between a couple grand and five hundred of them. And since someone will probably bring it up, yes, you could always roll your own CMS, but we all know how incredibly stupid that would be.<br /><br /><b>Configuration</b>. Ahhh, installing and configuring SharePoint. I've you've got access to a free-agent pharmacist, now would be the time to stock the team up with Xanax. We spent a couple months installing and properly configuring SharePoint, and we still occasstionally run across something that has to be fixed because it turns out that the installer didn't actually work or because it magically just broke, and the system gave no meaningful feedback when it did. You'll just looove the error messages that SharePoint gives you.<br /><br /><b>Documentation</b>. The challenge with documentation for SharePoint isn't the lack of it, rather its sheer volume. The surface area of the product means that you'll spend a lot of time wading through documentation, and it will almost always not be about what it is you're looking for. On the upside, there a litterally thousands of developers blogging about SharePoint, and someone has most certianly found a workaround for the problem you're having. Most of the books now available are still focused on the 2007 version, and there a large chunks of detail missing from MSDN, though this will surely change over time. Either way, there is a profound lack of good documentation specifically on using SharePoint as a web content management platform, I guess because until recently, nobody did.<br /><br /><b>Staffing</b>. Microsoft has gone to great lengths to play down the distinction that has traditionally existed between "SharePoint developer" and ".NET developer". And there's some truth to this claim. The new Visual Web Part and better XSLT support, among other things, are features that SharePoint virgins will certainly find familar. But don't be fooled. Good old fashioned .NET developers aren't going to magically turn into SharePoint gurus overnight. Or next week. Or probably this year. There's significant ramp up time, even for those with a good deal of experience in older versions, and you need to plan for it. Spend the time and money to get at least one true expert with real, recent, in-depth experience on the team to provide guidance. Make this person demonstrate their expertise in practicum when you interview because, let's face it, your guys won't know the difference, and it's far too easy to regurgitate a bunch of impressive sounding crap from MSDN when no one's the wiser.<br /><br />You'll probably also want to give your testing team some platform training, at least if you want any meaningful output from them. Your technical project managers, maybe your sales people, and anyone else who has the ability to commit you to any amount of development work, no matter how "easy" it might be, should also fair well from a good working knowledge of the tool.<br /><br /><b>Development</b>. For me, the real shock is what it takes physically, not mentally, for a developer to get work done. I'm a TDD guy. I like to write lots of silly little unit tests so I know that my code actually works. Sometimes this involves a mocking library, maybe a third party coverage analyzer, and if I'm feeling particularly masochistic, some static analysis or a duplicates finder. You probably can't find a single .NET developer on earth that doesn't have Reflector installed (thanks again Lutz), and a good percentage of your team are probably using Reshaper, NAnt, SSMS, Sandcastle, and twenty million other utilities. The point is, we all already have enough shit installed just to get good code written and out the door. Guess what. SharePoint is going to make it worse, much worse. In addition to everything I listed above, my team is using also using&nbsp;ULSViewer, CKSDev,&nbsp;U2U CAML Builder, Stamit CAML Viewer, SharePoint Manager, Dispose Checker, and SharePoint designer, all concurrently, just to build a "normal" SharePoint website.<br /><br /><b>Builds and Deployment</b>. Bye bye XCOPY. SharePoint deployment is a carefully orchestrated ballet, much like one of those pyramids made of svelte college cheerleaders. Nice to look at when it works, but an awful mess when something goes wrong (though not nearly as funny). A lot of the challenges of versioning and content promotion aren't unique to SharePoint, they're just part of life with a CMS, so you asked for it. Even so, SharePoint does have it's own set of quirks, more so if you're using automated builds or continuous integration. Plan for some extra work babysitting the build server.<br /><br />So what does all this really mean? It means that you have to do your diligence, all of it, in painstaking prophetic detail. SharePoint might be exactly what you're looking for, but you have to know this with 100% certainty. Involve the development team.</div></div>
