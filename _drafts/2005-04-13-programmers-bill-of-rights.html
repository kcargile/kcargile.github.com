  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div><span>Recent months have seen a welcomed turnaround for developers. As the economy has steadily improved and the number of professional developers on the marked has steadily decreased, the demand for high-quality talent has skyrocketed. Yet Im surprised to still find shops running high-pressure, high-turnover code-mills reminiscent of the two years following the dot-com bust.</span><br/><br/><span>Sadly, we have no one to blame for this phenomenon but ourselves. Allowing an employer or customer to operate a software sweatshop ultimately serves no best interest  we burn out, our family life suffers, and our customer gets a low quality product.</span><br/><br/><span>Its our responsibility as professionals to carefully manage our customers  and our industrys  expectations, else we tacitly approve a trend that can only damage us. </span><br/><br/><span>To this end, Ive constructed a simple list of terms that you can (venture I say, should) reasonably demand of your customer or employer:</span><br/><br/><span>Programmers Bill of Rights</span><br/><br/><span>1. You are entitled to respect.</span><br/><br/><span>2. You have the right to honest, open dialog with your customer.</span><br/><br/><span>3. Your technical vision is a valuable asset and should be treated as such.</span><br/><br/><span>4. You have the right to maintain an uncompromising commitment to quality.</span><br/><br/><span>5. You have the right to use the tools you need to best do your job.</span><br/><br/><span>6. You have the right to manage change.</span><br/><br/><span>7. You have the right to fair pay and shouldnt be expected to work for free.</span><br/><br/><span>8. You have the right to work reasonable hours.</span><br/><br/><span>9. You have the right to put your family first. Coworkers are NOT your family.</span><br/><br/><span>10. You have the right to not compromise your integrity.</span><br/><br/><span><span>11. You have the right to have fun and enjoy your work.</span></span><br/><br/><span>klc;</span></div>
