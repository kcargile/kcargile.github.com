summary: Dell issued a recall for just over four million laptop batteries early this morning. If you've followed the news in the past year or so, this probably doesn't come as a big surprise. Dell had a massive battery recall last year, and pictures of an exploding Dell laptop posted recently at the British <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550">Inquirer e-zine</a> have sparked even more concern that Dell's laptops pose a significant fire hazard. And nothing could be more embarrassing than a fire in your lap while you're watching <em>Bridget Jones' Diary</em> on your flight to that kickoff meeting in Hoboken.<br />

<div>Dell issued a recall for just over four million laptop batteries early this morning. If you've followed the news in the past year or so, this probably doesn't come as a big surprise. Dell had a massive battery recall last year, and pictures of an exploding Dell laptop posted recently at the British <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550">Inquirer e-zine</a> have sparked even more concern that Dell's laptops pose a significant fire hazard. And nothing could be more embarrassing than a fire in your lap while you're watching <em>Bridget Jones' Diary</em> on your flight to that kickoff meeting in Hoboken.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />But the laptop problems over the past year are only a small component of Dell's steady decline. Dell used to be <em>the</em> computer to have. Once upon a time, you could rely on Dell systems day-in and day-out. But the past several years have seen overall quality at Dell wane considerably, and their customer service has received failing ratings since at least 2004 (they once challenged me: "if you don't like our poor service, sue us"!!) What's really sad is that with IBM peddling the ThinkPad line off to the Chinese and AlienWare now under Dell ownership, the candidate pool of quality PC manufacturers appears to be slowly drying up.<br /><br />I suppose, however, that all good things must eventually come to an end -- the Ottoman empire, the Sopranos, NDoc, and yes, Dell.<br /><br />klc;</div>
