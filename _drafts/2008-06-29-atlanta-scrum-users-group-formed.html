summary: There's been a marked increase in the affinity for Agile development methodologies over the past few years, and the southeast is no exception. The number of project leaders seeking resources with bone-fide Agile experience seems to at least on-par with those looking for heavyweight contenders, and for good reason: done correctly, Agile works.<br /><br />That's not to say that ubiquity is a panacea. First and foremost, lightweight methodologies aren't the right fit for every situation. And even when they are, adoption is isn't without it's challenges. Many of the shops I've visited around town recently are struggling with implementations of XP or SCRUM -- think changing the tire on a moving dumptruck while you're reading the service manual, and trying to convince the driver a replacement is necessary, all at the same time.<br />

After almost 15 years in the software business, it still amazes me to the degree with which IT professionals are willing -- no, driven -- to share their experience and expertise with others in their field.<br /><br />Which is why I'm excited to see that Michael Fotunato has formed the Atlanta SCRUM User's Group. For Atlantans who are SCRUM practitioners or who are interested in learning more about SCRUM, the ASUG promises to be a first-class opportunity (for those of you not in Atlanta, chances that there is a user's group near you are high).<br /><br />For more information about the Atlanta SCRUM User's Group, visit their website at <a title="http://agile.meetup.com/38/" href="http://agile.meetup.com/38/">http://agile.meetup.com/38/</a>.<br /><br />To learn more about SCRUM, see the official website at <a title="http://www.controlchaos.com/" href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">http://www.controlchaos.com/</a>.<br /><br />klc;</div>
