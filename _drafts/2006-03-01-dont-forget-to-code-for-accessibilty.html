summary: You two have probably noticed that I've been neglecting my blog for the past month or so. And despite what you might think, this is not totally due to laziness. I severely injured my shoulder&mdash;we'll say, rescuing a pack of newborn puppies from certain doom&mdash;and am just now getting my dexterity back.<br />

  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div>You two have probably noticed that I've been neglecting my blog for the past month or so. And despite what you might think, this is not totally due to laziness. I severely injured my shoulder&mdash;we'll say, rescuing a pack of newborn puppies from certain doom&mdash;and am just now getting my dexterity back.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The point I want to make here is nothing revolutionary. But by being sans-arm for 3+ weeks I got a very, very, very small glimpse at how difficult it must be to navigate software for folks who are disabled (and there's a lot of it out there that's difficult to use). So if you are developing, particularly for the Web/UI layer, take a moment to familiarize yourself with <a href="http://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank">Section 508</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/" target="_blank">WCAG</a> if you haven't already. ALL of your users will thank you for it.<br /><br />klc;</div>
