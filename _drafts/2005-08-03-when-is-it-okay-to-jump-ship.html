summary: I was talking to some friends a couple of weeks ago about a project they'd been working on for just over six months. It's the model Death March project in every sense of the word -- consistent eighty-plus hour weeks, micro-management and daily distractions from the business owner, uncontrolled scope creep, and a marked lack-of-respect for the entire team. Its no surprise that this group has turned-over more than fifty percent in less than five months, and the guys who are still around look about forty hours from total, irreversible burn-out.<br />

  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div>I was talking to some friends a couple of weeks ago about a project they'd been working on for just over six months. It's the model Death March project in every sense of the word -- consistent eighty-plus hour weeks, micro-management and daily distractions from the business owner, uncontrolled scope creep, and a marked lack-of-respect for the entire team. Its no surprise that this group has turned-over more than fifty percent in less than five months, and the guys who are still around look about forty hours from total, irreversible burn-out.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />None of this is new to most of us of course, but my friends' different reactions to the project turmoil surprised me. When I asked what they were going to do about it, one developer remarked, I'm looking for something new. As soon as I find a good project, I'm outta' here. The other's answer was almost the polar opposite, I won't leave until my contract is up. It's unprofessional to leave in the middle of a project.<br /><br />This got me thinking: when is leaving a project -- if ever -- really justified? Some of us view this as an unprofessional move, but then you could easily argue that an employer behaving this way just as unprofessional. Others see moving around as a harsh necessity in a world where most projects fail anyways.<br /><br />I've been pondering this one for over a week now. I think I've finally come to a workable conclusion, but I'd like to hear what the rest of the development community has to say on the matter. How would (or have) you handle such a situation? Are you failing your customer by jumping ship, or are you failing yourself by not? And what's worse: being associated with a failed Death March, or being known for leaving one midway through?<br /><br />klc;</div>
